About Me

I’m an experienced program manager, writer, and education professional moving to a coding career. I’m seeking a new role that combines my leadership experience with developing skills in Python, SQL, and/or Java. I have exposure to HTML/CSS/ JavaScript but am drawn primarily to backend programming and databases. 

I work full-time at Tulane University, where I am currently completing a second bachelor's degree in Applied Computing Systems and Technology through evening classes with the School of Professional Advancement. I have also been able to take some of the undergraduate full-time courses as well. 

I will graduate in December of 2019 but am able to transition into a new position at any time given that my classes are held in the evenings. Ideally I'd like to wait until classes end this semester -- April -- but am available now for the right position.

My strengths include analyzing situations and outcomes with empathy, and synthesizing information to better communicate ideas and results to key stakeholders. My curiosity and creative background make me a unique candidate with a nontraditional yet practical approach to problem-solving.
